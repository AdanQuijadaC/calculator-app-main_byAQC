### I learned

I made this calculator app by reinventing the wheel, I already knew that there are several techniques to implement a calculated one, the wheel was already created but there is no point in copying and pasting, the idea is to perfect yourself, this work turned out to be a very impractical caveman code , the implementation of the keypad required knowing the keyCodes, that was what I needed to know.
